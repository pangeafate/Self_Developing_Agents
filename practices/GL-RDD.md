# README-Driven Development Framework

_A documentation-first approach to software development for self-developing agent projects_

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active Development Guidelines

---

## Philosophy

README-Driven Development (RDD) treats documentation as the primary design artifact. By writing documentation first, we clarify intent, establish contracts, and create a shared understanding before implementation begins. For AI agents building their own codebases, documentation serves a dual purpose: it is both the design contract and the persistent memory that survives context resets.

## Core Principles

### The Four Pillars

1. **Document First, Implement Second**
   - Write what you will build before building it
   - Documentation drives design decisions
   - Documentation becomes the contract
2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Small, focused modules (SRP - Single Responsibility Principle)
   - Clear boundaries between layers
   - Explicit dependencies
3. **Continuous Documentation**
   - Documentation evolves with code
   - Every change requires doc updates
   - Documentation is part of Definition of Done
4. **Predictable Structure**
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase
   - Self-documenting folder organization
   - Standardized file sizes and complexity limits

## Documentation Hierarchy

### Understanding a New Codebase (Sequential Process)

1. **Start with PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Understand what we are building
2. **Analyze the codebase** - See current development progress
3. **Review USER_STORIES.md** - Understand user stories and their implementation status
4. **Check FEATURE_LIST.md** - See detailed features with completion indicators
5. **Read GL-RDD.md and GL-TDD.md** - Understand development principles
6. **Review CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md** - Understand code organization rules
7. **Check ARCHITECTURE.md** - Understand system design and technical decisions
8. **Review PROJECT_ROADMAP.md** - See implementation plan from MVP to target state
9. **Check PROGRESS.md** - Review sprint history and current progress
10. **Review active sprint plans** - Understand current work in progress

```

## Module Splitting Guidelines

### CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- Architectural Principles

#### When to Split Files (Based on Architectural Concerns)

**ALWAYS SPLIT when a module violates these principles:**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle Violations**
   - Split when mixing: Domain Logic + I/O Operations + Utilities
   - **Domain Logic**: Business rules, validation, entity behavior, workflows
   - **I/O Operations**: Database calls, file operations, network requests, external APIs
   - **Utilities**: Formatting, parsing, helpers, transformations

2. **Multiple Component/Feature Mixing**
   - Split when combining multiple unrelated components or features
   - Each component should have its own focused module

3. **Layer Boundary Violations**
   - Split when mixing different architectural layer concerns

#### When NOT to Split Files

**KEEP INTACT when modules follow established patterns and remain cohesive:**

1. **Service Pattern**: All operations for a business capability belong together
   - *Exception*: If service mixes orchestration + I/O + utilities, separate by concern type
2. **Repository/Client Pattern**: All CRUD operations for an entity belong together
   - *Exception*: If repository mixes business rules with I/O, extract business rules
3. **Entity/Model Pattern**: All behavior for a domain entity belongs together
   - *Exception*: If entity includes I/O operations, extract those
4. **Adapter Pattern**: All operations for external integration belong together
   - *Exception*: If adapter includes business logic, extract to separate module

**Resolution Rule**: When pattern cohesion conflicts with SRP, prioritize SRP.

### Quality Metrics (Supporting Guidelines)

#### Complexity Indicators (Review Triggers)

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: >10 suggests review needed
- **Cognitive Complexity**: >15 suggests complexity reduction
- **File Dependencies**: >8 imports suggests tight coupling
- **Function Parameters**: >4 parameters suggests complex interface

These are review triggers, not hard limits. A module exceeding one metric may be fine; exceeding two or more demands splitting.

## Layer Boundaries & Rules

### Dependency Direction

```
Capabilities (execution) -> Shared Logic (lib) -> Models (data) <- Config (settings)
```

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibilities | Forbidden | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capabilities | Script execution, API orchestration, output formatting | Business logic in spec files, direct config access | -> Lib |
| Shared Logic (Lib) | Business logic, API clients, data validation | Script execution, agent interaction | -> Models, Config |
| Models | Data structures, enums, validation rules | External dependencies, I/O | <- (No dependencies) |
| Infrastructure | Setup scripts, container config, deployment | Business logic | -> Config |

### What Each Layer Produces

- **Capabilities**: Executable scripts that the agent invokes; each has a spec (SPEC.md) describing inputs/outputs and a `scripts/` directory with implementation.
- **Shared Logic**: Importable Python modules containing business rules, service functions, API client wrappers, and data transformations.
- **Models**: Pure data definitions (dataclasses, enums, type aliases) with optional validation. No side effects, no I/O.
- **Infrastructure**: One-time or periodic setup: database migrations, deployment scripts, environment configuration.

## Development Checklist

### Pre-Development

```
[ ] Problem clearly defined
[ ] README / capability spec written
[ ] Interfaces designed
[ ] Dependencies identified
[ ] Tests outlined
```

### During Development

```
[ ] Following README-driven approach with TDD (Document -> Test -> Code)
[ ] Maintaining single responsibility per module
[ ] Separating domain logic, I/O operations, and utilities
[ ] Updating documentation as implementation evolves
[ ] Adding error handling
[ ] Including logging
```

### Pre-Commit

```
[ ] All tests passing
[ ] Coverage meets threshold (80%+)
[ ] No modules mixing domain logic + I/O + utilities
[ ] Single responsibility principle maintained
[ ] Layer boundaries respected
[ ] Documentation updated
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Do Not:

- Create monolithic modules that violate SRP
- Mix concerns across architectural layers
- Skip error handling
- Use magic numbers/strings
- Create circular dependencies
- Document after implementation
- Skip tests for "simple" code

### Do:

- Keep modules focused (SRP)
- Maintain clear layer boundaries
- Handle all error cases explicitly
- Use configuration/constants
- Design clear dependency graphs
- Write documentation first
- Test everything, including edge cases
